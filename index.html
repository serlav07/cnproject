                <p>
                We showcase contemporary plays written by women. This website it's also a useful tool for networking and creating a virtual hub where young women playwrights can meet established playwrights.
                </p>
                <p>
                <b> Only 3 productions out 12 </b> 
                were written by women in the  Autumn November 2018 - August 2019 season at the National Theatre.
                </p>
                <p>
                 We aim, through this website, to encourage young playwrights to write and write and write in the hope that the playwriting industry will <b>reach gender parity by April 2025.</b>
