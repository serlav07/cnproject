                Our Mission
            </h1>
            <p>
            <b>Women's New Playwriting 2025 </b>is a project that came to life with the enormous support of <b>Arts Council Lottery Funds 
            Awards</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
            The project was a neccessary answer to the survey "What share of the Cake?" commissioned by Sphinx Theatre Company in 2019. The study reveals that women's positioning in the arts is still underrepresented.
            It also shows that theatres with male theatre directors will employ less women writers than theatres where the artistic directors are women.
            </p>
            <p>
            We believe that through a strong mentoring scheme these facts can change. The creation of this website is of outmost importance in order to create bridges between the management at the top and writers.

             Our outreach programme aims to find playwrights coming from different backgrounds, with different education levels and different ages in an attempt to find new and diverse voices. 
            </p>
            <p>The playwrights showcased on our website have had experience working in different venues, from studio theatres to West End theatres and have worked collaboratively in devising new pieces of theatre.
